🛠 Project Process

1️⃣ Data Collection & Loading

Collected churn dataset (local dataset in CSV format).

Loaded into Excel and cleaned for analysis.


2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.

Handled missing values.

Standardized column names for consistency.


3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used Pivot Tables, Charts, and Filters to analyze:

Customer churn distribution.

Service usage trends.

Seasonal churn patterns.

Retention vs. lost customers.



4️⃣ Key Metrics Calculated

Total Customers: 951

Customers Retained: 675

Customers Lost (Churned): 276

Churn Rate:

Churn Rate = (Customers Lost / Total Customers) × 100
           = (276 / 951) × 100
           = 29%


5️⃣ Visualization

Created bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for churn trends.

Highlighted seasonal patterns (February peak churn, March sharp drop).

🔍 Insights

1. High churn rate of 29% — Significant number of customers are leaving.


2. Peak churn in February, followed by a sharp decline in March, suggests possible seasonal effects or service promotions.


3. Some services show higher churn rates than others — may indicate dissatisfaction or better offers from competitors.


4. Customers with low engagement levels have higher chances of leaving.

Improve Service Quality: Focus on underperforming services with high churn.

Engagement Boost: Introduce campaigns to keep low-usage customers active.

Feedback Loop: Collect regular customer feedback to address pain points before they churn.
