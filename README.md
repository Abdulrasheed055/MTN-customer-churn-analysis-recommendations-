* Project Process *

1 Data Collection & Loading

Collected churn dataset (local dataset in CSV format).

Loaded into Excel and cleaned for analysis.


2 Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.

Handled missing values.

Standardized column names for consistency.


3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used Pivot Tables, Charts, and Filters to analyze:

Customer churn distribution.

Service usage trends.

Seasonal churn patterns.

Retention vs. lost customers.



4 Key Metrics Calculated

Total Customers: 951

Customers Retained: 675

Customers Lost (Churned): 276

Churn Rate:

Churn Rate = (Customers Lost / Total Customers) √ó 100
           = (276 / 951) √ó 100
           = 29%


5 Visualization

Created bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for churn trends.

Highlighted seasonal patterns (February peak churn, March sharp drop).
